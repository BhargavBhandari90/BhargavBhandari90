## üöÄ About Me

I am a passionate WordPress developer from Bilimora (Gujarat, India) with over a decade of experience in web development. My journey began as a PHP developer working with Magento and Joomla, but in 2014, I discovered WordPress and I've never looked back. Since then, I've contributed to the WordPress ecosystem as a core contributor and have worked on WP-CLI.

In 2018, I transitioned to remote work and have been thriving in a distributed environment ever since. I'm deeply passionate about remote collaboration, which allows me to stay productive and flexible while working with teams across the globe.

Lately, I've been focused on creating custom WordPress blocks, exploring the Gutenberg editor, and building intuitive, user-friendly block-based solutions. I also run a YouTube channel with over 2000 subscribers, where I regularly share tutorials, tips, and insights to help others master WordPress.

Outside of development, I enjoy riding my bike and playing PlayStation games‚Äîactivities that keep me inspired and energized.
